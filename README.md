# Discord Bot Template
This template was built to make it easier for developers to bootstrap a discord bot together, quickly and effeciently. It sets the foundation for building a scalable and more maintable discordjs bot.

## Motivation
The reason for this bot was to remove the overhead of setting up the foundation and standards for every bot I created. This was repetitive and took time to do. So, I wanted a template with this all set up and ready to go, so I can get right into development. If one person is having this issue, odds are someone else is, so I wanted to make this an open-source project.

## Installation
